                                 ** SUBPART **

INTRODUCTION

SUBPART is an ISPF Edit command (macro) to submit JCL to the Internal Reader
for batch processing. It allows for the selection of which data records are
to be submitted.

Syntax:    subpart (with lines selected)
        or subpart first last
        or subpart nx
        or subpart ?

Data Line Selection is by excluding those lines that are not to be submitted
and then use subpart nx or selecting the desired lines using SS or S#.

Note: By excluding the lines not to submit the desired lines do not have to
be contiguous.

INSTALLATION

Copy the SUBPART member, which is the REXX exec, into a library in your
SYSEXEC, or SYSPROC, allocations.
