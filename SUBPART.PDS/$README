                                 ** SUBPART **

INTRODUCTION

SUBPART is an ISPF Edit command (macro) to submit JCL to the Internal Reader
for batch processing. It allows for the selection of which data records are
to be submitted. LRECLs other than 80 supported.

Syntax:    subpart                 (with lines selected)
         or subpart 1st# last#     (e.g. 3 21)
         or subpart 1stlab lastlab (e.g. .a .b)
         or subpart nx             (non-excluded records)
         or subpart *              (all records)
         or subpart ?              (tutorial)
         or subpart                (tutorial)

Data Line Selection is by excluding those lines that are not to be submitted
and then use subpart nx or selecting the desired lines using SS or S#.

Note: By excluding the lines not to submit the desired lines do not have to
be contiguous.

INSTALLATION

Copy the SUBPART member, which is the REXX exec, into a library in your
SYSEXEC, or SYSPROC, allocations.
